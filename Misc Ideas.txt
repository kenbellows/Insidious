~Miscellaneous Ideas~

Description: Something cool come to mind? Add it here!

Part 1: Story/ Gameplay
-------------------
-   The heroes keep dying and respawning to fight you again. Because they keep fighting you,
	they are becoming stronger and stronger just like you are.
-   



Part 2: STRICTLY Gameplay
-------------------
-   "Intimidate" enemies
	+ intimidation negatively affects the recipient's stats (movement speed, reaction time, etc.)
	+ purchase armor to intimidatingly discard in front of heroes to inflict it
	+ purchase abilities to inflict intimidation (battle cry, aura dispersion, etc.)
-   purchase AI controled minions to fight along side you
	+ cost is proportional to the minion's health, damage, etc.
	+ different types of minions or simply stronger versions of the basic kind?
	+ pay a lot to "resurrect" a boss that "was already defeated". Basically, bosses are
	     the strongest type of minion you can have
	+ perhaps have access to abilities to enhance your current minions temporarily/forever
