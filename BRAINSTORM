~Brainstorming Sheet~

Description: The core and essential elements of the game; in addition to other ideas agreed upon


Part 1: Gameplay
-------------------
-   Section 1: Storyline
    * You are the final boss in an RPG.
    * Heroes of all kinds come to try and defeat you.
    * You must fend off many enemies one at a time, while consistently getting stronger or laying traps.
	(Should you gain abilities or just new types of traps?)
    * Utilize the weapons left behind by your enemies to lay traps and/or equip yourself against future
	enemies.


-   Section 2: Items



Part 2: Programming
----------------------
-   Section 1: Class Hierarchy

    - Drawable   // Anything that is drawn should extend a single drawable class (or one of its subclasses), which will handle all of the background stuff.
      | - Level/Map/Background...   // This will be the class that holds the level background, perhaps with two drawable objects: one for the background (e.g. cave wall) and one for the floor (i.e. the surface on which the players can walk).
      | - Sprite   // Anything that moves on the screen should extend Sprite (or one of its subclasses).
          | - Character   // Pretty self-explanatory
              | - Boss (main character)
              | - Hero (enemy)
          | - Item
              | - Weapon
              | - Ammo
              | - Pickup (powerups, useable items, etc.)
          | - Scenery
       | - HUD   // There will only be one of these.
