Project Insidious will become a game based around the following brainstorming ideas:

You play as a Bad Guy. Specifically, a boss hiding in his lair, being attacked by would-be heroes, or "Good Guys".

You are assaulted one good guy at a time, perhaps occasionally in small waves.

Each hero/wave has a unique ability.

Each wave (or perhaps only some) affects the lair in some permanent way.
	- Example: Big strong guy comes through, does a ground pound, and leaves behind a small crack/or weakness

The effects left behind can be utilized by the protagonist.
	- Example: Use that crack to crate a hole in the ground as a trap, or to hide a bomb in the ground, etc.

In order to take advantage of the effects, utilize a wide set of materials in a "closet"/"bag of tricks"/"shop".
